# Description
Cross-Domain Requirement Linking via Adversarial Domain Adaptation  
RADIATION is used to train the requirements linking model from the source domain and then test the requirements linking performance in the target domain (a different domain).

- main.py contains the first phase (Requirements Linking Sample Construction) and the fourth phase (Target Linking Model Construction) of the RADIATION model
- core/pretrain.py contains the second phase of the model (Pre-training the Linking Model in the Source Domain) of the RADIATION model
- core/adapt.py contains the third stage of the model (Distance-enhanced Adversarial Representation Adaptation) of the RADIATION model
- The params folder contains model configuration information and running parameters
- data/processed folder contains the dataset mentioned in our paper, and we provide the processed version of the original dataset

# Packages
- torch
- pandas
- pytorch_pretrained_bert

# Run the code
python main.py  
You can change the data paths of the source and target domains in the parameter configuration of main.py.

# Models
Models consisting ofï¼š  
1) an encoder trained on the source domain;  
2) a trained classifier on the source domain;  
3) a target domain encoder trained in the adversarial adaptation phase
